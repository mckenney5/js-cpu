JS-CPU
==============
_A custom virtual CPU emulator using plain JavaScript_


## Description
This program simulates a custom CPU with a custom ISA. There is built in support 
for pixel manipulation, along with loading programs into memory. There is currently 
no operating system built in, so stack manipulation and memory managment has to be 
done manually. The intent of this program is to help teach how a CPU and an OS works 
under the hood.
